# Loan Default Analysis

## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors influencing loan defaults. The dataset contains information about past loan applicants and their loan statuses, and the goal is to identify patterns that indicate whether a person is likely to default.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains loan data from 2007 to 2011, including various consumer and loan attributes.

## Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

- **Loan Amount**: Most loan amounts are within a specific range with a few higher amounts.
- **Loan Term**: Loans are evenly distributed between 36 and 60 months.
- **Interest Rate**: Interest rates vary with a noticeable spread.
- **Loan Grade**: Grades B, C, and D are the most common.
- **Annual Income**: Annual incomes vary widely with most in a specific range.
- **Loan Status**: Majority of loans are either fully paid or current, with fewer charged-off loans.

### Bivariate Analysis

- **Loan Amount vs Loan Status**: Loan amount distributions vary by loan status.
- **Interest Rate vs Loan Status**: Interest rates tend to be higher for charged-off loans.
- **Annual Income vs Loan Status**: Annual income distributions also vary by loan status.
- **Loan Status by Term**: Loan status distributions show differences based on loan term.
- **Loan Status by Grade**: Loan status distributions show differences based on loan grade.

## Conclusion

Identifying risky loan applicants can help in reducing credit losses by taking informed decisions such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or lending at higher interest rates.
